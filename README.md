# AmazonDatabase
This was a project I completed at Pace University as a Graduate Assistant in the Seidenberg Applied Data Science and Networking Lab.
It serves to replicate an Amazon database with customers, products and orders. Included in this project is the data, tutorials, and SQL scripts written by myself and my colleague.
